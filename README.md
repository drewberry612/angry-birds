For this project, I created an Angry Birds clone, a demolition game, in Java using JBox2D. Angry Birds is a mobile game where you use a slingshot and birds to knock down structures that house green pigs, that have stolen the birdsâ€™ eggs.

-----------------------------------------------------

My game consists of 3 levels that demonstrate the core gameplay of Angry Birds, but were solely designed by me. I implemented my own bespoke physics to the engine, using a ContactListener, to create something that is incredibly similar to the real game. This game includes visuals and sounds taken from the Angry Birds games. The sounds play when there are any collisions or actions made by the player. The game also includes a scoring system that promotes using less birds to beat a level, and a timer for plays to get optimal times. I have implemented 4 types of birds and 2 types of pigs; 3 types of material for building structures, each with their own properties; explosives, which must be hit at a certain speed to detonate; and ropes for more complex structures.

The angrybirds.mp4 video in this repository shows all 3 levels with the menus connecting them.
